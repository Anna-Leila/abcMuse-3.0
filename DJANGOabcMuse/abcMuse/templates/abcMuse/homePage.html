    <!-- welcoming sign and rules of the game -->
    <h1>Welcome to demo version of mini-game abcMuse!</h1>
    <p>Rules:</p>
    <p>You should choose the total number of vowels and consonants.
        The program will show the amount of every individual letter.
        Each new configuration will be random. You have to think of
        as many words with available letters as you can. Each letter
        with positive amount will raise your score by 1. If You use
        a letter with zero amount, your score will reduce by 1. Try
        to get the highest score possible.
    </p> <br>
    <p>
        If You enter several words at a time and your score is positive,
        the program will search for these words in “Hamlet” play by William
        Shakespeare. It will show you the line with maximum number of words
        in it, if this number is more than one.
    </p>
    <p>
        This funny word game will cheer You up and become a mental gymnastics.
        Don’t forget to tell your friends about it! Good luck!
    </p> <br>

    <p>The author is planning to modify the program for many users and present a new intellectual TV show or stream based on the game</p>
    <p>The game can also be integrated into existing educational platforms or used as an independent international educational project in parallel language cultures and literary traditions</p>
    <p>You can help the development of the project as well as the creation of the versions on other languages, including Chinese: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/VZoikin">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/VZoikin</a></p>
